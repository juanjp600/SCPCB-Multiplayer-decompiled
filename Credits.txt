	A big thank you to everyone who's supported the project during these years
	- it would have	never gotten to where it is now without your help.

	SCP-CB has been a big collaborative effort with dozens (maybe even hundreds?)
	of people creating material and giving ideas and feedback for the game, and
	I'm sure I've forgotten to mention some of you here. If you've contributed
	something to the game and would like your name to be added here, drop
	me a message on the Undertow Games forum or contact@undertowgames.com!
	- P. S. Don't contact anymore, original is discontinued :)

	- Joonas Rikkonen ("Regalis"), Lead Developer of the original
	
	A big smile for all community members of SCP - Containment Breach!
	Ultimate Edition would have not come this far if it were not for the support,
	ideas, and love for the original by Regalis. Thank you Jabka, Vane, and many
	other Containment Breach mod project leads out there for continuing to create mods
	that would give life to the original. Thank you (ex-) team members and helpers who
	worked on this mod. If you would like to contact us for anything
	such as missing credits or bugs then contact us on Discord! Link on the Launcher.
	
	- Snoebrawler, Lead Developer of the Ultimate Edition
