# SCP - Containment Breach Multiplayer

As far as I'm aware, this mod never had its source code released. This code was produced using [B3DDecomp](https://github.com/juanjp600/B3DDecomp) on [executables that can be obtained on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782380/SCP_Containment_Breach_Multiplayer/).

The generated code has been slightly modified to disable the server list.

To build this mod, you will need [mavless bin](https://github.com/Regalis11/scpcb/blob/master/mavless_bin.zip) (lol what a misnomer) and [patch the Large Address Aware flag](https://ntcore.com/?page_id=371) because this uses too much memory to run without that.

The game is based on the works of the SCP Foundation community (http://www.scp-wiki.net/).
