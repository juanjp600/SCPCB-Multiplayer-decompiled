# SCP - Containment Breach Multiplayer Reborn

This code was produced using [B3DDecomp](https://github.com/juanjp600/B3DDecomp) on [executables that can be obtained on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3257000/SCP_CB_Multiplayer_Reborn/).

If I'm not mistaken, to build this mod, you will need [ZiYueCommentary's fork of Blitz3D TSS](https://github.com/ZiYueCommentary/Blitz3D) and [patch the Large Address Aware flag](https://ntcore.com/?page_id=371). I haven't actually checked if this compiles at all :)

The game is based on the works of the SCP Foundation community (http://www.scp-wiki.net/).
