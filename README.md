# SCP - Containment Breach Multiplayer

This code was produced using [B3DDecomp](https://github.com/juanjp600/B3DDecomp) on [executables that can be obtained on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782380/SCP_Containment_Breach_Multiplayer/), and some executables that the community has produced now that the original project has been cancelled.

The generated code has been slightly modified to remove references to the central server, which disables the server list and breaks the server's ability to authenticate players. Reimplementing the central server is out of scope for this repository.

To build this mod, you will need [mavless bin](https://github.com/Regalis11/scpcb/blob/master/mavless_bin.zip) (lol what a misnomer) and [patch the Large Address Aware flag](https://ntcore.com/?page_id=371) because this uses too much memory to run without that.

The game is based on the works of the SCP Foundation community (http://www.scp-wiki.net/).
